# QT-Tourism-Agency-App
This project -**Tourism Agency App** is an application built with C++ and QT for graphical user interface(GUI). This app is part of my last project for OOP course. This project allowed me to consolidate and applay a wide range of concepts I learned throughout my course. Key topics include:
  -Rule of three and Rule of five
  -Memory Management (dangling pointers, smart pointers)
  -STL class Vector Implementation (iterators and templates) 
  -Graphical User Interface: delving into QT framework I learned about slots and signals for event handling and applied
  design patterns such as : **Observer**, **Model-View_controllwe**, **QPaint**
  **Features**
  -add/remove/edit offers
  -sorting and filtering
  -whishlist functionality-> users can add an existing travel offer or random travel offers to a wishlist and export
  the file to a .csv or .html file
  -undo operation
  -histogram visualization-> graphical representation of travel offers of the wishlist 
  -observer pattern ->ensure the UI updates dynamically when data changes
