# QT-Tourism-Agency-App
This project -**Tourism Agency App** is an application built with C++ and QT for graphical user interface(GUI). This app is part of my last project for OOP course. This project allowed me to consolidate and apply a wide range of concepts I learned throughout my course. 
**Key topics include:**  
  -Rule of three and Rule of five  
  -Memory Management (dangling pointers, smart pointers)  
  -STL class Vector Implementation (iterators and templates)   
  -Graphical User Interface: delving into QT framework I learned about slots and signals for event handling and applied  
  design patterns such as : **Observer**, **Model-View_controllwe**, **QPaint**
